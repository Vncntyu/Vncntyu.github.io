                of Maryland undergraduates studying business, engineering, and/or science. In his first semester of
                QUEST, Vincent worked with his team to consult for the Engineering Career Services of the A. James Clark
                School of Engineering at UMD. He analyzed old process for ECS
                volunteer registration and check-in to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, as well as programmed
                with Google App Script to create an automated process, saving the client ~ 5hr/week on
                manual data entry.</p>

                to utilize Power BI to
